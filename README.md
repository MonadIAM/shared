<summary><strong>Installation</strong></summary>

The package is distributed directly from git and is not published to npm. To install in a consuming project:

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/MonadIAM/shared.git#v1.0.0
```
> A version tag after `#` is required. Without it, npm will resolve to the latest commit on the default branch.
